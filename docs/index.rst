Welcome to DL Data Validation Toolset's documentation!
======================================================

The DL Data Validation Toolset is a framework built around a series of tools meant to help establish if a generated HDF5 file for the DL in HEP effort contains valid data. Each test is meant to be run as a unit test on a generated file and establish what the file contains along with problems that might arise due to using this file for deep learning.
